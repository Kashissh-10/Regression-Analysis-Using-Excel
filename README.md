# Project: Sales Forecasting for an Umbrella Company Using Regression Analysis in Excel
conducted a **Regression and Multiple Regression Analysis** in Excel to forecast **umbrella sales** based on key weather factors: **rainfall, temperature, and windspeed**.

# Tools Used:
Microsoft Excel (Data Analysis ToolPak, Statistical Functions, Charts)

# Project Objectives:
- Identify and quantify the impact of weather conditions on daily umbrella sales.
- Build a predictive model to help optimize inventory and sales strategies.

# Approach Used:
- Collected historical sales data alongside corresponding **rainfall, temperature, and windspeed** figures.
- Applied **simple regression** to evaluate the individual impact of each weather factor.
- Performed **multiple regression analysis** to understand how the combination of these variables influences sales.
- Used Excelâ€™s **Data Analysis ToolPak** to derive key metrics.
- Analyzed outputs including **R-squared, coefficients,** and **p-values** to assess model accuracy and variable significance.
- Visualized relationships through **scatter plots, trendlines**, and **residual plots** for diagnostic purposes.

# Key Insights & Results:
- **Rainfall and Temerature** showed a **strong positive correlation** with umbrella sales, while **windspeed** had **negative effects**.
- The multiple regression model achieved a **high adjusted R-squared**, indicating good predictive power.

# Outcome:
This project enhanced my ability to apply statistical modeling techniques in a real-world business context using Excel. It also demonstrated the value of integrating external data (like weather) into sales forecasting for operational efficiency.
